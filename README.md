# 🔒 Security Risk Mitigation

## 🔐 Security Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Description | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| Prompt Injection | Malicious inputs embedded inside resumes or PDFs attempting to manipulate agent behavior or override system instructions | The system mitigates prompt injection by applying strict input sanitization during the PDF parsing stage using Docling-based extraction. Since resumes may contain hidden(Like we CANT IDENTIFY with out EYES if that malicious prompt and BACKGROUND COLOR of resume are SAME) or embedded malicious instructions, the extracted text is cleaned and filtered before being passed to the LLM. This ensures that any injected prompts inside PDF content are neutralized during preprocessing. Additionally, strict prompt separation and structured output validation using schemas further prevent execution of unintended instructions. |
| Data Privacy / PII | Resumes may contain sensitive personal data such as email addresses, phone numbers, and identity details | No raw PII is stored in the database. The system uses SHA-256 hashing for file identification and stores only metadata such as candidate ID, file hash, candidate name, total score, structured score JSON, JD hash, and timestamps in the `hr_db`. Additionally, LLM prompts and responses are stored separately in a `langchain_cache_db` for caching purposes, ensuring traceability without exposing sensitive user data. |
| API Key Exposure | Risk of leaking API credentials or secrets in source code or logs | Environment variables via `.env`, secured with `.gitignore`, and use of `python-dotenv` |
| Hallucination Risk | LLM may generate incorrect or fabricated scoring or interpretations | The system reduces reliance on a single LLM output by using a multi-layer scoring pipeline: (1) semantic similarity via cosine similarity engine, (2) weighted rubric matrix for deterministic scoring, (3) LLM-based evaluation for contextual reasoning, and (4) a fallback heuristic scoring mechanism in case of failures. Additionally, confidence is boosted when verifiable signals such as GitHub profile links are present, as they provide external validation of candidate credibility and reduce hallucination impact. All outputs are enforced through Pydantic schema validation and structured JSON generation to ensure consistency. |
| Unauthorized / Malicious File Access | Risk of uploading malicious files (e.g., disguised executables like .exe renamed as .pdf) to the processing pipeline | The system implements multi-layer file validation to prevent malicious uploads: (1) file extension validation to ensure only allowed formats are accepted, (2) MIME type verification to confirm actual file content type, (3) file size checks to reject empty or corrupted uploads, and (4) magic byte inspection (e.g., `%PDF` header validation) to ensure the file structure matches a genuine PDF. These layered checks collectively ensure that only valid and safe PDF documents enter the processing pipeline. |
| Duplicate Processing | Same resume uploaded multiple times leading to redundant computation | SHA-256 file hashing with SQLite-based deduplication before processing |

## ⚡ Performance Optimization & API Cost Reduction

The system is optimized to reduce unnecessary LLM API calls and improve overall processing efficiency through multiple pre-processing and caching strategies.

Before invoking any LLM-based agents, resumes are first pre-filtered using semantic similarity matching with Sentence Transformers. A cosine similarity-based comparison between job descriptions and resumes is performed to eliminate clearly irrelevant candidates early in the pipeline, significantly reducing downstream LLM usage.

Additionally, a caching mechanism is implemented to avoid redundant processing of previously evaluated resumes. If a resume (identified via file hash) has already been processed, stored results are reused instead of triggering repeated embeddings or LLM calls.

These optimizations ensure that only high-relevance candidates proceed to expensive LLM-based scoring, thereby reducing API cost, improving latency, and increasing system scalability.

## 📡 Observability & Execution Logs

The system implements structured logging across all pipeline stages to ensure full traceability, performance monitoring, and debugging capability in a production-like environment.

Each request is tracked with detailed metadata including stage-level execution status, latency metrics, model usage, semantic scores, and extracted candidate insights.

### 🔍 Example Pipeline Execution Trace

- 📄 PDF Extraction (Docling):  
  Successfully extracted structured text from resume with ~2076 characters in ~4.99s processing time.

- 🧠 Resume Parser Agent (Gemini):  
  Candidate processed using `gemini-2.5-flash` with ~11.1s latency, extracting ~30 skills and ~5.5 years experience.

- 📊 Semantic Matching Engine:  
  Cosine similarity score computed: **0.5210**, with skill overlap score: **0.07**

- ⚡ Embedding Layer:  
  Combined similarity pipeline executed with real-time scoring and logging.

- 📡 API Observability:  
  All LLM requests tracked with request/response metadata, latency, and structured JSON logging.

### 🧾 Logged Metadata Includes:

## 🚧 Challenges Faced & Engineering Solutions

During the development of the AI Resume Screening system, several real-world engineering challenges were encountered and addressed to ensure robustness, security, and production readiness.

### 📄 Handling Malformed Resumes
Resumes often came in inconsistent formats (scanned PDFs, corrupted layouts, or unstructured text), making extraction unreliable. This was addressed using Docling-based parsing with fallback extraction logic to ensure consistent structured output.

### 🛡️ Preventing Prompt Injection Attacks
Resumes occasionally contained hidden or embedded instructions attempting to manipulate the LLM. A dedicated sanitization layer was implemented during preprocessing to remove or neutralize malicious content before reaching the model.

### ⚠️ Reducing LLM Hallucinations
To avoid unreliable AI-generated outputs, the system uses a hybrid scoring pipeline combining cosine similarity, weighted rubric scoring, and heuristic fallback logic, rather than relying solely on LLM responses.

### ⚡ Managing API Usage Efficiently
LLM API costs and latency were optimized using semantic pre-filtering (Sentence Transformers) and caching of previously processed resumes to avoid redundant calls.

### 📊 Designing Reliable Scoring Heuristics
A multi-factor weighted scoring system was designed (skills, experience, projects, education, communication) to ensure deterministic and explainable candidate evaluation.

### 🧾 Ensuring Structured LLM Outputs
All LLM responses are enforced through Pydantic schemas and strict JSON validation to guarantee consistent, machine-readable outputs across the pipeline.
